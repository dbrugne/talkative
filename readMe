// Usage //
///////////

To get this script to work:

-include talkative.js and talkative.xml in your page. Both must be placed in the same folder. (if you don't want that, read the 'Important' section)
-add the 'id="verb"' attribute to the HMLT elements that needs to be animated. (see Example in index.html on line 14)
-add the 'id="interest"' attribute to the HMLT elements that needs to be animated. (see Example in index.html on line 16)
-add the 'id="target"' attribute to the HMLT elements that needs to be animated. (see Example in index.html on line 18)
-you're done: just refresh your page.

talkative.js handles the animation stuff, and talkative.xml contains the data for the text's variations in both english and french.
The language is retrieved from the html tag (<html lang='en'>). default is English

-In case you need talkative.xml to be placed in a different folder, please change the value of the variable 'pathToXML' in talkative.js on line 19.

-You can customize the various timers that are used by the script in talkative.xml to further fit your needs in user experience. Here are a few pieces of information about those timers.
	*verbTimer: the Interval between 2 verbs animation (in ms)
	*interestTimer: the interval between 2 interests animation (in ms)
	*targetTimer: the interval between 2 targets animation (in ms)
	*fadeDuration: the time it takes to perform an animation (in ms)
	*startingDelay: The time waited by the script before starting animating. This is useful when you want the user to be able to read the original text at least once first. (in ms)

-Obviously you can add as many verbs (<v></v>), interests (<i></i>), or targets (<t></t>) as you want as long as you respect the XML structure.

This was freely and happily made by Maaya especially for the donut.me project. The script is thus not that flexible.
I put no licence on this you do what you want.
